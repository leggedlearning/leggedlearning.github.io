## Overview <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

Physical simulation is an important tool for robotics. While simulation has been well-established for robotics education and integrated robot software testing for a long time, only recently the robotics community has made significant progress in transferring capabilities learned in simulation to reality, a concept termed Sim2Real transfer.

Sim2Real refers to a concept of transferring robot skills acquired in simulation to the real robotic system. Sim2Real draws its appeal from the fact that it is cheaper, safer and more informative to perform experiments in simulation than in the real world -- yet, Sim2Real faces significant challenges.

In this workshop we invite well-known researchers to debate the state of the art and the impact of Sim2Real on robotics. In this workshop we invite well-known researchers to debate the state of the art and the impact of Sim2Real on robotics. The proposed workshop is the third edition of a <a href="./rss2019">workshop that happened at R:SS 2019</a> and at <a href="./rss2019">R:SS 2020</a>. In this year‚Äôs edition, we aim to review the actual progress in Sim2Real more critically by changing the workshop format: inspired by the ICRA 2019 robotic debates workshop, for this workshop we will invite top-researchers to participate in debates focussed on controversial key topics with a few spotlight presentations.

## Call for Contributions <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

Participants are invited to submit extended abstracts (maximum 2 pages in length, excluding references). We encourage both position papers as well general sim2real submissions.

Accepted abstracts will receive a poster presentation slot and selected submissions will additionally be allowed to give a spotlight presentation for 5min each, ahead of the debate that's most in line with the subject.

Submissions must be in PDF format following the [IEEE style](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html).  Submissions must include a short abstract. The extended abstract should go in the main section of the template and the short abstract in the abstract section.
