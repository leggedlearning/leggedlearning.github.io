## Overview <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

Physical simulation is an important tool for robotics. While simulation has been well-established for robotics education and integrated robot software testing for a long time, only recently the robotics community has made significant progress in transferring capabilities learned in simulation to reality, a concept termed Sim2Real transfer.

Sim2Real refers to a concept of transferring robot skills acquired in simulation to the real robotic system. Sim2Real draws its appeal from the fact that it is cheaper, safer and more informative to perform experiments in simulation than in the real world -- yet, Sim2Real faces significant challenges.

In this workshop we invite well-known researchers to debate the state of the art and the impact of Sim2Real on robotics. The proposed workshop is the second edition of a <a href="./rss2019">workshop held at R:SS 2019</a>. The R:SS 2019 workshop had the goal of surveying the state of the art in Sim2Real for robotics, with a focus on robotic manipulation, and featured invited talks from top researchers in the field of Sim2Real. In this year’s edition, we aim to review the actual progress in Sim2Real more critically by changing the workshop format: inspired by the ICRA 2019 robotic debates workshop, for this workshop we will invite top-researchers to participate in debates focussed on controversial key topics with a few spotlight presentations.

<a name="topics"/>

## Debate Topics <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

In contrast to the R:SS 2019 edition, we changed the format from invited talks to **debates**. Each debate will focus on a key - rather controversial - statement regarding Sim2Real, and will be discussed by two proponents and two opponents of that statement. Each debate consists of short introductory pitches by the two sides, providing an opportunity to presenters to also highlight their work, followed by a moderated discussion. An example list of statements includes:

> *Why* sim2real? - "Investing into Sim2Real is a waste of time and money“

> *What* is sim2real? - "Sim2Real is old news. It’s just X (X=model-based RL, X=domain randomization, X=system identification, ...)"

> *How* to sim2real? -  "For successful sim2real transfer, there is no alternative to accurate simulation.“


<a name="structure"/>

## Debate Structure <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

We will adhere to the following debate structure (Total time per debate: 50 min)

1. Introductions (5 min = 4 debaters x ~1 min each)
2. Opening arguments (20 min = 4 debaters x 5 min each)
3. Moderated discussion between debaters (15 min)
4. Closing remarks (10 min = 4 debaters x 2.5 min each)


<a name="call"/>

## Call for Contributions <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

Participants are invited to submit **extended abstracts (maximum 2 pages in length, excluding references)**. We encourage justified position papers (wrt. to the aforementioned debate points) but we allow other sim2real-related entries as long as they mention in the submission notes how they relate to one of the subjects (e.g. a work about a new visual grasping sim2real method might mention that it's ONLY reporting sim2sim performance since their simulation is sufficiently detailed).

Accepted abstracts will be given the opportunity to record a short pitch video, and receive an online Q&A slot during the live session of the virtual workshop.

* Submissions must not exceed *2 pages in length, excluding references*.
* Submissions must be in PDF following the IEEE style available from<br/>
  [https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* Submissions must include a short abstract. The *extended abstract* should go in the main section of the template and the *short abstract* in the abstract section.
* Anonymous submissions are not required.

<a name="schedule"/>

## Schedule <a href="#toc" class="top-link">[Top]</a>

Taking inspiration from the ICRA 2019 Debates on the Future of Robotics Research, the workshop will consist of three debates. Every debates focuses on a single key question and is structured as follows:
Poster teasers related to debate topic (3-5 minutes each depending on number)
Pitch by proponents (2 researchers), 15 minutes
Pitch by opponents (2 researchers), 15 minutes
Debate, 45 minutes

We will be soliciting poster submissions for the workshop. We will review the contributions by putting together a program committee with experts in the field. We will have two poster sessions during the coffee breaks along with teaser presentations.

We will conclude the workshop with a panel discussion focusing on the question on how Sim2Real and real-world experimentation can be combined in the best way to achieve the best of both worlds.
